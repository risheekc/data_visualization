README for Risheek Chemudupati Data Visualization Final Project

Description of Project: This is an exploratory visualization based on the data from Mendeley Data provided by Ben Cutting from a study funded by the University of Oxford concerning sleep and health data. 

Installation/Build Instructions: Download the file and edit the "filepath."

Design Process: Used a variety of different approaches to visual design (bar plots vs. line plots vs. scatter plots), found that heatmaps were quite useful using altair and could be used to be interactive, then applied that as a filter based on the documentation. Different colors were chosen, and eventually lineplots to study sleep quality and sleep duration data across multiple different categorical and continuous variations using interactive heatmaps (using altair) was the way to go.
